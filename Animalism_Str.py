bond famulus
When Blood Bonding an animal,
the vampire can make it a famulus,
forming a mental link with it and
facilitating the use of other Ani-
malism powers. While this power
alone does not allow two-way com-
munication with the animal, it can
follow simple verbal instructions
such as “stay” and “come here." It
attacks in defense of itself and its
master but cannot otherwise be
persuaded to fight something it
would not normally attack.
■ Dice Pools: Charisma + Animal
Ken
■ Cost: The animal must be
fed the users Blood on three
separate nights, each of which
requires a Rouse Check by
the user. The amount of Blood
needed to sustain the ghoul-
state of the animal after this is
negligible. Players starting with
this power have completed this
process and can chose a famu-
lus for free.
■ System: Without the use of
Feral Whispers, below, giv-
ing commands to the animal
requires a Charisma + Animal
Ken roll (Difficulty 2); increase
Difficulty for more complex or-
ders. A vampire can only have
one famulus, but can get a new
one if the current one dies. A
vampire can use Feral Whispers
(Animalism 2) and Subsume
the Spirit (Animalism 4) on
their famulus for free.
■ Duration: Only death releases a
famulus once bound. As long as
it receives vampire Blood on a
regular basis, the famulus does
not age."""
sense_the_beast=""" Level 1 sense the beast
The vampire can sense the Beast
present in mortals, vampires, and
other supernaturals, gaining a sense
of their nature, hunger, and hostil-
ity.
■ Cost: Free
■ Dice Pools: Resolve + Animal-
ism vs Composure + Subterfuge
■ System: Roll Resolve + Animal-
ism vs Composure + Subter-
fuge. A win allows the user to
sense the level of hostility in a
target (whether the person is
prepared to do harm or even
determined to cause it) and
determine whether they harbor
a supernatural Beast, marking
them as a vampire or were-
wolf. On a win, a critical gives
the user information on the
exact type of creature, as well
as their Hunger or Rage level.
This power can be used both
actively and passively, warning
the user of aggressive intent in
their immediate vicinity.
■ Duration: Passive"""
feral_whispers="""Level 2
feral whispers
The vampire can commune with
the beasts of the wild and the city.
Feral Whispers allows two-way
communication with animals. A
cat might not be interested in
debating Matisses use of color but
happily discusses the lack of prey
around the brownstone building
across the street. Depending on the
C O R E B O O K2 4 6
vampires skill, they can even per-
suade animals to perform services;
like humans, animals seldom agree
to things that go against their
nature or endanger them.
Vampires can also use Feral
Whispers to summon a chosen type
of animal (see Animalism limita-
tions above) but the animals must
be present to answer. Nothing pre-
vents a vampire trying to summon
an orca in Central Park, but success
seems unlikely. Summoned animals
listen to the summoner, but scatter
or attack if endangered.
■ Dice Pools: Manipulation +
Animalism, Charisma + Ani-
malism
■ Cost: One Rouse Check per
type of animal chosen for the
scene. Allows one summoning
and unlimited communication.
Free when used on famulus.
■ System: Simple communica-
tion requires no dice pool
test. Persuading an animal to
perform a service requires a
Manipulation + Animalism
roll; the Difficulty depends
on the task required. Having a
bird keep an eye out for any-
one entering the park at night
is Difficulty 3, while ordering
any animal to defend a place
with their lives is Difficulty 6.
Summoning animals uses
a Charisma + Animalism roll;
Difficulty depends on the scar-
city of the animals summoned.
The number of animals sum-
moned depend on the margin
on the test; a critical win sum-
mons most, if not all, animals
of the type in the area.
■ Duration: One Scene"""
