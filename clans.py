Banu_Haqim_Info="""

Banu Haqim are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Judges of the Banu Haqim are torn between their hereditary thirst for vampiric Blood and their passion for justice. Stern adjudicators, they are fiercely devoted to upholding a moral code, and Embrace mortals capable of assessing and handling threats, enforcing laws and traditions, and punishing transgressors.

Regardless of the individual Banu Haqim's stance, they all adhere to some type of strict code, be it blood laws, personal ethics, governmental or religious rules. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean they are free of self-interest, and often such codes of conduct are a self-regulation method to keep in check their desire for Kindred blood. The Banu Haqim's instinct to find the guilty is intrinsic to the Blood and not bound by religion; those guilty of whatever transgression a Child of Haqim deems unforgivable must be punished, and punishment might even include taking their unlife from their veins through diablerie. They are also not tied to a specific cultural or geographical background, and modern Banu Haqim hail from all over the world, representing various beliefs. Their individual code is also not necessarily tied to a faith, and may come from personal convictions rather than religion"""

Hecata_Info="""Hecata are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. A motley collection of necromantic vampire bloodlines, the Hecata clan are united in the pursuit of a single subject: Death. They are students of the afterlife and resurrectionists of the dead — or worse. Selling their services to the highest bidder, or acting in their own interests, there are few who can hide from the surveillance of those who can summon and command the very spirits of the deceased.

A clan steeped in death, they practice the arts of necromancy and communication with the dead. The clan tends to favour mortals either from their own mortal family or those with useful connections to other outside families. It is speculated that the reason all Hecata share the same Disciplines unlike their ancestors is caused by the unification of the necromantic bloodlines that formed clan Hecata and the destruction of so many Giovanni elders.

At Storytellers discretion, a few changes to the Discipline line up may be made depending on the character's bloodline either through replacement of a power with another or by offering a unique 4-dot merit to unlock a fourth in-clan discipline. The following changes may be made; Giovanni line may replace Auspex with Dominate, Samedi may replace Auspex with Obfuscate, Lamiae may replace Auspex with Potence and the Nagaraja may replace Fortitude with Dominate. Keep in mind the requirements for certain Amalgams should a player want them.[2]

With the nature of their bane, the Hecata have developed methods to feed safely. Through blood bags and corpses or extracting blood from their victims without the use of their fangs. They have a habit of feeding on herds or from members of their own family, however this brings strife as resentment and fear builds between them.

    Presence is the power which they have mastered, using it in conjunction with Auspex to pierce and manipulate the minds of mortals and Kindred alike. Be it to engage in carnal pleasures or to take their fill of blood."""
Toreador_Bane="""Bane

Aesthetic Fixation - A desire for beauty takes control over the Toreador and when in lesser surroundings they suffer. When they are within settings they find less than beautiful, they take a penalty equal to their Bane Severity when using Disciplines.[4]
Variant Bane

Agonizing Empathy - Whenever their feeding causes Aggravated damage to a mortal, the vampire suffers the same damage in return but cannot receive more than their Bane Severity. This damage is generally Aggravated. The damage itself is reflected as vivid bruising wherever they bit their victim as internal bleeding takes place"""
Toreador_Compulsion="""Compulsion

Obsession - Utterly obsessed with a single thing, the Toreador cannot speak of anything but that object. Be it a person, a piece of artwork, a blood splatter in the right lighting, or the sunrise itself, they cannot take their attention from it. Any other actions receive a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion lasts until they can no longer perceive the object or the scene ends"""
Tremere_Info="""Tremere are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The arcane Clan Tremere were once a house of mortal mages who sought immortality but found only undeath. As vampires, theyve perfected ways to bend their own Blood to their will, employing their sorceries to master and ensorcel both the mortal and vampire world. Their power makes them valuable, but few vampires trust their scheming ways."""
Tremere_Disciplines="""Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Tremere as well as the uses they find in it.[2]

    Auspex allows the Tremere to perceive the truth from their surroundings, hunting down hidden objects and communicate long distances with others without fear of being heard. When in a pinch they use this power to find a pliable victim to feed from.
    Dominate gives the Warlocks the ability to do anything for knowledge and get away with it. Theft, betrayal, and anything else with lesser ethics are easily covered by manipulating the minds of others. They show little remorse when using this power to feed as well when needed.
    Blood Sorcery grants them the ability to release devastating attacks against their foes, protecting themselves in turn and ease feeding. Some Thaumaturgy uses this power to sap the blood from a mortal's body without physical touch. This expertise in unlocking the secrets of blood makes them a valued if not mistrusted member of the Camarilla."""
Tremere_Bane="""Bane

Deficient Blood - Before the fall of Vienna, they were defined by their rigid hierarchy of Blood Bonds within the Pyramid. After the fall, their Blood weakened and rejected all prior connections. Tremere are unable to Blood Bond other Kindred, though they can still be Bound by other clans. Tremere can still Blood Bond mortals to do their bidding, but the vitae must drink an additional amount of times equal to their Bane Severity.[2]
Variant Bane

Stolen Blood - When performing a Blood Surge they need to make Rouse Checks equal to their Bane Severity. If these Rouse Checks increase their Hunger to 5 or higher, they can choose whether to back off their Blood Surge or perform it to then hit Hunger 5 afterward immediately."""
Tremere_Compulsion="""Compulsion

Perfectionism - Nothing but the best will satisfy them, anything less than exceptional still instills a profound sense of failure. When afflicted by this, the Warlock suffers a two-dice penalty to all dice pools. The penalty is reduced to one die when actions are being repeated and removed entirely on a second repeat. This does not end till they managed to score a critical win on a Skill roll or the scene ends."""
Tzimisce_Info="""Tzimisce were introduced in the Vampire the Masquerade 5th Edition Companion Guide. The dragons view ownership above all, they aim to conquer and rule the subject of their possessiveness. Traditionally their charges were based on geographical locations, hence the stereotype of a vampire in a looming castle. However, in the modern age, the younger generations have taken a more loose approach, staking claim over mortals rather than their land. Their desire to own is only limited by their lack of expansion, but once they've sunk their claws in they are hard to shake loose.

These possessive traits extend beyond others and property and into their own body. Many dragons specialize in a form of Protean known as Vicissitude which allows them to alter their bodies how they deem fit, including the bodies of others willing or not. These Tzimisce go beyond just the physical perfectionism and lean into the metaphysical and stretch the very limits of vampirism itself. Transforming their bodies into statues, or altering the traits of gender, reaching as far as to create groups of mortal lookalikes to subsume their individuality. Some tales even speak of Dragons going as far as to become one with their haven, merging into the soil of their domain.

This, of course, creates a divide between the older and younger Tzimisce where the younger have had less time to cultivate their ownership while the other doubles their control. It's no surprise to hear that the Tzimisce were active participants in the Anarch Revolt and were one of the founding clans of the Sabbat. Even tonight, with the Sabbat shattered, others are wary of them and their cunning abilities. With the elders controlling so much, many younger members are driven from the Black Hand and towards the Anarchs to redefine themselves and their charges. A few Tzimisce find comfort within the Camarilla, finding a familiar comfort in its neo-feudalism even if the tower itself has little love for them."""
Tzimisce_Disciplines="""Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Tzimisce as well as the uses they find in it. [2]

    Animalism allows them to extend their oneness with their domain, as well as extend their command over the lesser beasts in their territory.
    Dominate enables them to enforce their edicts through mental force.
    Protean has its purpose beyond changing into animal shape. Growing alongside their ability to Dominate they unlock their ability to use Vicissitude."""
Tzimisce_Bane="""Bane

Grounded - Each Tzimisce must select a specific charge, be it physical location, a group of people, or something even more esoteric. Each night they must sleep surrounded by their charge, if they do not, they sustain aggravated Willpower damage equal to their Bane Severity upon waking the following night.[2]
Variant Bane

Cursed Courtesy - If they wish to enter a place of residence uninvited they must spend Willpower equal to their Bane Severity, this penalty also applies to their Discipline pools while they are there. The invitation inside can only be made by someone who lives there and this does not occur in uninhabited homes or public places. Tzimisce with this Bane cannot take the uninvited Folkloric Block."""
Tzimisce_Compulsion="""Compulsion

Covetousness - When afflicted with this compulsion they become obsessed with owning something in the scene, be it an object, or property to a living person. Whatever it is, they must add it to their collection and any action taken not towards this purpose incurs a two-dice penalty. This penalty continues until ownership is established or the object of their desire is unobtainable."""
Ventrue_Info="""Ventrue are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Ventrue are not called the Clan of Kings for nothing. Carefully choosing their progeny from mortals familiar with power, wealth, and influence, the Ventrue style themselves the aristocrats of the vampire world. Their members are expected to assume command wherever possible, and they’re willing to endure storms for the sake of leading from the front.[1]

To them, they are the rightful heirs of power and command. The Ventrue have held more positions of power than any other clan; as god-kings in ancient Babylon to majority shareholders and campaign fund backers in the modern age, they've held their footing as long as they could. Though in recent nights their status has begun to slip, many Ventrue feel their time is running out and as their privileges slip through their fingers, most Ventrue tighten their grasp, willing to fight fang and claw to keep hold.

Clan Ventrue has long been the leader of the Camarilla, even after losing their most prominent representative, Hardestat, to a Brujah assassination. A majority of the clan believes that the strength of tradition and lineage is what holds them above the rest. Though these nights they are careful, blending into humanity behind the scenes. Resentment is building from having to control the strings from behind the curtain, but curtailing the Masquerade and possible breaches that would follow should they not is crucial.

Even outside of business they function as if one. They are the establishment that so many aims to destroy. They set and maintain the rules, they punish those who do not keep them with the occasional treat for those who do. Those who do not like their methods call them tyrants for keeping Kindred down. However, without them, the Camarilla and in turn, the Masquerade would have fallen long ago."""

    Dominate is used to guide the masses they lead, be it Kindred or mortal. It also serves its purpose when hunting to force a mortal to show their neck or to protect the Masquerade in a situation gone wrong.
    Fortitude keeps the Ventrue able to withstand the storms when their lesser fight against them. This power has its use for them to stand against adversity and feed, where others might struggle with blood, they take their fill.
    Presence is the alternative to mind control. Used to sway their courts and loyal followers to adore them regardless of their less than ethical approaches. With their value of conservation, this aids them in easily finding prey to take their fill upon."""
Ventrue_Bane="""Bane

Rarefied Tastes - When the Ventrue drinks the blood of a mortal who does not fall within their preference, they must spend Willpower equal to their Bane Severity else they will vomit the blood from their bodies unable to slake their hunger.

With a Resolve + Awareness test, they can sense if a mortal they seek to feed from fits within their preference. At character creation, their preference should be selected. [3]

Caitiff_Info="""Caitiff exhibit no discernible lineage, the Caitiffs are vampires without a clan. Distrusted by their peers, they are scorned because of their lack of lineage but also feared for their unpredictability. Jacks of all trades but masters of none, each Pander makes their own way in the society of the damned, free from ancestry and expectations both.[1]

Representative of vampires in their purest form, the Caitiff do not suffer from the lineage of their Blood. Due to this, they are usually cast out by their clans either from shame, envy, or fear. The Caitiff take their distance either in shame or pride, born from the unique traits missing from their sire's clan. Caitiff embraces are not always accidental; it's assumed that the clanless do not target mortals for the embrace, but that is incorrect. In the modern night, the Panders are becoming an increasingly large force. As survivors, most do not gather together, and without their binding blood, they are more individualistic than those within clans. The mortals they seek for the embrace are generally strong-willed or accustomed to hardship. Their position in Kindred society is the bottom of the rung, after all, only above the Thin-blood who shouldn't have been created at all."""

thin_blood_Info="""Thin-bloods are neither entirely vampire nor mortal, the ever changing nature of the Duskborn evokes pity, jealousy, and fear in equal measure. Considered little more than trash by most vampires, the thin-bloods are banding together, leveraging their resistance to sunlight and the strange, mercurial adaptability of their powers against their oppressors.[1]

They are clanless and not considered a clan by most Kindred, as they are the result of embraces too far from the progenitor, Caine. Created by the arrogant Kindred who believed to be closer to the potentiator than they were, a victim of a murder and the guilt forced the hand of a Kindred to embrace or just an experiment of a Tremere gone wrong. The thin-bloods are a high-generation group, often cast out and shunned by Kindred society. Viewed as a threat to the Masquerade, many will destroy them if given the opportunity. Thin-bloods can be of any mortal origin and are not affected by their sire's bloodline.

In 2009 the Inner Circle of the Camarilla issued an edict that all Thin-bloods must be branded. A task accomplished by a Tremere tattoo artist or even scorched into their skin using the sun. Even Anarch and Autarkis will think twice before mingling with a branded thin-blood. [2]

Through rumors and stories, there are tales of thin-bloods finding a way out. Even if they do not age, eventually they must decide to remain within the night or adapt to their new lifestyle and remain in the sun. Diablerie is the first choice, upon taking the soul of another vampire they join their clan and inch closer to Caine. Removing all Thin-blood traits and characteristics as they become a fully-fledged vampire. Sometimes this is rewarded as a prize to those who show themselves capable to the tower and sometimes this is a spur-of-the-moment decision against a Kindred who has been left vulnerable by others. The other choice is that of a way out, stories of those who have returned to the sun and become mortal once more. The stories usually entail thin-bloods clinging to their humanity and ending their sire. But then again, any mortal who knows about Kindred is a threat to the Masquerade and must be taken care of. [3]
Characteristics

Resting in the Generations from 14th to 16th, they lack the Blood Potency to use most vampiric powers and instead must use their ways to survive. Their human-like traits allow them to take less damage from the sun and some may even walk in it without harm. Their distance from Caine has prevented them from succumbing to frenzies and they remain almost lifelike compared to most vampires. However, the negatives outweigh the cost. This distance also removes their ability to learn and master Disciplines, instead only able to utilize them if their Blood flows with the proper Resonance from their last feed. They are also weaker than the average Kindred and take damage as if they were still mortal. Due to their Blood Potency of 0, they cannot create Blood Bonds nor Embrace with any certainty, only able to ghoul a mortal for the duration of one night with enough Blood. [4]

Thin-Bloods, unlike the rest of the clans they do hold a unique trait. Known as Thin-blood Merits and Flaws, they can be curated by the player to pick and choose different advantages and weaknesses unique to only them and create the perfect almost vampire. See Merits and Flaws. """
thin_blood_Disciplines="""Disciplines

Thin-bloods created the art of thin-blood alchemy, granting them the potential to create new and replicate existing Disciplines from vitae and other sources. The Merit Thin-blood Alchemist can be taken at Character Creation to begin with level 1 in the Discipline and one formulae, however, if it is not taken they can still traverse Alchemy at the in-clan experience rate.

Whenever they feed from a Resonance, they are granted one dot and one power in a Discipline tree associated with the Resonance. If the Resonance is Intense or stronger, they gain an additional dot in conjunction with a second power. This, however, is only temporary as the rating cannot be increased with experience points and is lost upon hitting Hunger 5 or the next feeding. With the thin-blood Merit Discipline Affinity, they are able to select one Discipline and traverse the tree as if a True Kindred.[3]
