animalismDisciplines["bond famulus When Blood Bonding an animal,the vampire can make it a famulus,forming a mental link with it and facilitating the use of other Ani-malism powers. While this poweralon does not allow two-way com-munication with the animal, it can follow simple verbal instructionssuch as stay and come here. It attacks in defense of itself and its master but cannot otherwise be persuaded to fight something it would not normally attack. Dice Pools: Charisma + Animal Ken Cost: The animal must be fed the users Blood on three separate nights, each of which requires a Rouse Check by the user. The amount of Blood needed to sustain the ghoul- state of the animal after this is negligible. Players starting with this power have completed this process and can chose a famu- lus for free. System: Without the use of Feral Whispers, below, giv-ing commands to the animal requires a Charisma + AnimalKen roll (Difficulty 2); increase Difficulty for more complex or-ders. A vampire can only have one famulus, but can get a new one if the current one dies. A vampire can use Feral Whispers (Animalism 2) and Subsume the Spirit (Animalism 4) on their famulus for free. Duration: Only death releases a famulus once bound. As long as it receives vampire Blood on a regular basis, the famulus does not age."];
